Icons in headings do not have any functional meaning, so they should be hidden from screen readers.

Weather icons represent the weather condition, so we should add a title attribute to them to ensure screen readers can
properly interpret the icons.

For the day name, minimum, and maximum temperature, we should add appropriate title attributes.

Chrome DevTools has accessibility tree to track what screen readers see.
